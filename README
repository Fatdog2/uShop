A universal shopping application made for me to better understand 
how to use node, express, mongoDB and pug. 

It has all the main features of a normal shopping app and has two
different target audiences being both shops and users/customers

Note: It doesn't use proper industry standards for some things 
e.g password authentication or password hashing due to me wanting 
to spend more time on other things.
One big thing is user and shop login, instead of using sessions and cookies, 
I just have the Id present in the url, this is not secure at all, in future I 
would use something like Passport.js and using its Oauth and mongoose functions.

Note 2: Also, it isn't as responsive as I would like it to be.

A universal shopping application made for me to better understand 
how to use node, express, mongoDB and pug. 

It has all the main features of a normal shopping app and has two
different target audiences being both shops and users/customers

Note: It doesn't use proper industry standards for some things 
e.g password authentication or password hashing due to me wanting 
to spend more time on other things

Note 2: Also, it isn't as responsive as I would like it to be.
